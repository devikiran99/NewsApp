# NewsApp  

  I developed a modern News Application in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose, designed to deliver the latest headlines and search-based articles by integrating the NewsAPI. The app follows the MVVM architecture pattern with dependency injection, ensuring clean code structure, scalability, and maintainability. For data fetching, I implemented Retrofit to consume RESTful APIs and integrated pagination, allowing articles to load efficiently on demand, reducing network usage and improving performance. To support offline access and enhance user experience, I used the Room Database for local caching of news articles, ensuring users can still browse previously fetched content without an active internet connection. On the testing side, I carried out instrumented testing for Jetpack Compose UI components and utilized JUnit Runner for unit and integration testing, ensuring the appâ€™s reliability and correctness. With a strong focus on performance, user experience, and robust architecture, this project demonstrates my expertise in building scalable Android applications that combine modern UI, local storage, real-time API integration, and thorough testing practices.
